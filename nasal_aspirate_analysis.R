# Which parameters did you use and why? 

# I am trimming off 20 from the beginning of the reads
# When I trimmed only 10 bases, I lost ~50% of my reads later
# Github forum suggest trimming more of the beginning of the reads
# If primer sequences aren't removed, it can cause too many to be considered bimeras
# Forum also suggested relaxing truncation length and maxEE:
# with insufficient overlap, dada2 can't merge F-R
# 
# What was the largest and small number of raw reads?
# Largest: B166_R1.fastq.gz -- 249713
# Smallest: Neg16_R1.fastq.gz-- 108
# What was the largest and small number of filtered reads?
# Largest: B166_R1.fastq.gz -- 208273

## ------ Dr Ishaq's method -------------

# Dr. Ishaq's method creates vectors out of the SV table data for negative controls, and subtracts those SVs from the sample data.  Depending on the type of negative control, these are removed from the whole data set or from subsets of batches. Remove PCR and sampling materials negative control SVs fully from all samples, and remove extraction kit SVs fully from each dna_extraction_batch, respectively.

### Alpha diversity plotting ------------------

# This script was getting too long and busy so I have split the plotting
# See separate .R file named nasal_aspirate_plots



# richness plot with significance added
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsignif)


# richness plot observed SVs with lines to fit the view screen
plot_richness(EX_ps_clean.rar, 
              x="Treatment", #CHANGE ME, A is whatever factor you want on x-axis
              measures="Observed", #CHANGE ME, whatever richness you want. = c("Observed","Shannon")
              title = NULL) + 
  theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14)) + 
  geom_violin(trim=TRUE, aes(fill=Diet)) + #optional. CHANGE ME, A is whatever factor to color violins
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, aes(group=Treatment)) + #optional. CHANGE ME, A is whatever factor to group boxplots
  # theme(legend.position = "none") + #use to get rid of your legend
  ylab("Observed Bacterial Richness (SVs)") + 
  ylim(0,1500) + #define the y axis min/max
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1, y = 1200, xend = 2, yend = 1200)) +  geom_text(x = 1.5, y = 1250, label = "***") # add a drawn in line and significance tag, adjusting the x and y coordinates till it fits where you want in the window.  Add another for each line to add. As written, this will fit the view window you have, if you adjust that your segments will not adjust with it.
