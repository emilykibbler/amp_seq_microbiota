# amp_seq_microbiota
This is a project I developed as part of my amplicon sequencing class.

All code is based on a detailed R program developed by Dr. Sue Ishaq.
This can be found in DADA2_Ishaq_amplicons_walkthrough_ESK_notes.R

There are several data sets analyzed here. These are the directory names and sources.
