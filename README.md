# amp_seq_microbiota
This is a project I developed as part of my amplicon sequencing class, which I then expanded as part of an independent study course.

Most of this code is based on a detailed R program developed by Dr. Sue Ishaq.
This can be found in DADA2_Ishaq_amplicons_walkthrough_ESK_notes.R

First analysis was on this data:
Henares, D., Rocafort, M., Brotons, P., de Sevilla, M. F., Mira, A., Launes, C., Cabrera-Rubio, R., & Mu√±oz-Almagro, C. (2021). Rapid Increase of Oral Bacteria in Nasopharyngeal 

Second was on this:
Crovetto, F., Selma-Royo, M., Crispi, F. et al. Nasopharyngeal microbiota profiling of pregnant 
women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sci Rep 12, 13404 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17542-z

For the second project, I compared Dr. Ishaq's pipeline with the Qiime2 pipeline which has been published on their website, qiime2.org
I leaned heavily on their tutorials.
